In his later years after high school, he had gone to a 4-year university to pursue his dreams of being a NASA employee. He was top of his class every year and always got the best grades and awards. He started work as a Harvard science professor until he felt ready to apply for NASA.

            <span>Cheems was in so much despair that he had no idea what to do with himself. One day he got a call from his younger brother Cheebs and reminded Cheems how good of a leader he is. With that inspiration, Cheems thought to run for president, the best job for his personality.  Cheems heard the people’s cries and replied with his good heart and helped as many as he could. He kept this up until the day of election where he versed Joe Biden and Donald Trump. While Cheems may be a dog, he was still the kindest and most hard working individual candidate. Everyone agreed with his morals and what he supported. Cheems is now the president of the United States and plans on winning the next election, so don’t vote otherwise.</span>

        <p>	The United States youth is the future of this country.</p>
        <p>When the standardized school system was first introduced it taught youth how to be an officer worker in the 80’s.</p>
        <p>In today's day and age there are very few 9-5 jobs compared to previous times.</p>
        <p>This means youth are learning how to live in a time that has already passed.</p>
        <p>I believe that students should be allowed to learn many different skills and not just the standard 4 that are required in today's age.</p>
        <p>I as a candidate want to give students the opportunity to explore realistic world jobs and careers and I promise to open up the school requirements to allow creativity and advancement in our youth.</p>

        <p>From The Revolution to World War 2 to Afghanistan the world has proven that peace was never an option.</p>
        <p>This was what the great Goose taught us.</p>
        <p>Thus the United States must maintain a strong military and allow for the citizens to overtake an oppressive and freedom lacking government.</p>

        <p>The people of the United States are lazy. It's as simple as it comes.</p>
